# Private Surveillance
This project is about to develop a simple system base on:
    - Raspberry Pi 3 with a camera module
    - Python 2.7
    - OpenCV
    - Twilio

The target is to:
    - Detect motion from camera
    - count person number from video
    - send SMS to specified phone number if the alarm threshold triggered(exceed number of person in picture, detect person with mask, etc...)
